# Claude Instructions

Canonical instructions are maintained in `AGENTS.md` at repository root.

Operational rule:
- Treat `AGENTS.md` as source of truth.
- Keep this file synchronized whenever `AGENTS.md` changes.
- On any code/content file change, check whether instruction updates are needed; if needed, update both files in the same change.
